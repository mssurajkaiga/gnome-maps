We are pleased to announce the second release of Maps, a map 
application for GNOME.

Changes since 3.9.5 are:
 - Search results are now shown in a drop-down menu instead of
   as markers on the map.
 - We now draw our window decorations client-side, following
   the trend of many other apps during this cycle.
 - The user location button is no longer a toggle button.
 - We now have both buttons in the map and key bindings for
   zooming in and out, in addition to using the mouse-wheel.
 - We depend on the fresh GeoClue 1.99 release, which acts
   as a DBus system service.
 - Added/updated/fixed translations:
   - Chinese simplified
   - Danish
