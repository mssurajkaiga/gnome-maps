We are pleased to announce the second release of Maps, a map application
for GNOME.

User visible changes since 3.9.5 are:
 * Search results are now shown in a drop-down menu instead of
   as markers on the map.
 * We now draw our window decorations client-side, following
   the trend of many other apps during this cycle.
 * The user location button is no longer a toggle button.
 * We now have both buttons in the map and key bindings for
   zooming in and out, in addition to using the mouse-wheel.

Maps is licensed under GNU GPLv2+.

Dependencies (runtime):

* gjs
* geoclue
* geocode-glib
* champlain
* champlain-gtk
